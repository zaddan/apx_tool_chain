flow:
compile the CSource file
run CSourceFile to generate accurate values

use genetic algo to run the CSource file with different apx_number of bits:
    Note: everytime Change the OperatorSampleFile (modifyOperatorSampleFile) to 
    get new operators (meaning with different number of apx bits). 


The Csource code is compiled only once, but run many times (with different operatores)






the following files are not included in the git repo but should be provided
inputs.py in src/pythonfiles/
all_input_scenarios.txt in the root 
settings.py 
CMakeLists.txt needs to get modified to incorperate the .h files associated with the 
files within CSrc folder
make sure to populate CSrc with files that you want to approximate. 
make sure to provide all the files that have AdditionOp and MultiplicationOp (that you want to appx) in the inputs.py in lOfCSrcFileAddress
