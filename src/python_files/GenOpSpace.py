# @file GenOpSpace.py
# @brief this file contains the class for generating all the possible apx version of an operation that is defined as a class
# @author Behzad Boroujerdian
# @date 2015-06-30


## 
# @brief this class generates all the possible versions of a specific operator. it ueses the name to figure out the type of input. for example, in the case of multipliation, it generates all the multipliactions possible such as accurate and apx version (apx versions can have different kinds)
#some of the inputs are just names and some of the inputs are ranges and need to be first generated and then permutated. 
#for example the name passed to this class, is just one element and doesn't need to be expanded, but the rest of the inputs acquire a low bound and high bound
#the way to use this class is the following way:
#set the numberOfInputs. For example in the case of Eta1 the number of inputs equal 8. These inputs include the low bound and high bound of the followi
