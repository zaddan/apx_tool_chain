  • .n  this result is bogus since the energy was not getting collected for float,
 float multiplication  n.
  • .n  since the data regarding the optimal setup per input is collected w/o
 energy being normalized, the graphs are comparable, however, we can still look
 at the success_rate and the promised_vs_ideal (which are both acquired from the
 avg scnario. However, if we want to do an energydiff, we need to re collect
 data for optimal points ass-w/ each input  n.
