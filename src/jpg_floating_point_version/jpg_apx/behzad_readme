run make file
then: ./output 10   (or any other number, the higher the number the lower the quality of the picture)
   the picture will be generated in two format. bmp, jpg. You start with a bmp file, which is fixed(lena.bmp) in
   this code (we can change it later), and you end up with a jpg and also and output file called
   lena_final.bmp. 
   compare the len.bmp with the lena_final.bmp (for before and after jpeg process)




steps required to make a file suitable for the set up:
    changes required for the C/Cpp files.
    break the main to the modules that their behaviour need to be evaluated
    add the writeOutput module and provide it with the outputfile Name.
    add comments to the portion of the C that can be approximated
    get rid of the writeOutput to the modules that you don't need.
